\subsection{Dataset}
We have conducted experiments on the following datasets(Mainly For Phase 1):
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | c |}
  \hline                        
  Dataset Name & Advogato  \\ \hline
  Largest conn compo & 5054  \\ \hline
  Size & 6551 vertices  \\ \hline
  Volume & 51332 edges \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

In out final experiment suit, a more large and diverse datasets from different domains will be explored. The tentative source of experiment dataset are listed below:
\begin{description}
	\item{{\bf SNAP:}}{It has abundant data about social network, we plan to conduct triangle counting, pagerank, radius computing experiment which will reveal the underlying feature of large graphs and spot strange graphs.}
	\item{{\bf Konect:}}{Konect has more diverse datasets compared to SNAP, like citation network. It's a good target to analyze features of non-social networks, we will examine whether such networks follow power law by generating degree distribution, etc.}
\end{description}

We also calculated statistics about the weakly connected components in table \ref{table:wcc}.We compute radius for every node in Advogato dataset, the result is in table \ref{table:radius}:
