In this study, we focus on how to implement various graph mining algorithms based on RDBMS. Since the introduction of MapReduce, it has been considered the only silver bullet in large scale data analysis. While from database's perspective, RDBMS has been equipped with all the requierd capabilities for over twenty years. So why not RDBMS? We want to justify RDBMS's role in future big data application by experiment with current graph mining algorithms using RDBMS. The main contribution of this study is to explore the limitation in RDBMS's expressiveness and scalability, which scenario RDBMS will be a more appropriate alternative than MapReduce.
