We implement all the graph mining algorithms using Postgres's embedded PL/pgSQL programming language, which supports many advanced features, like user defined function, aggregate, etc. It also has a sophisticated query execution engine, which we think is the most critical component of Postgres.

The following are the algorithms we plan to implement. The reason we choose them is that there are a lot of implementation in other platform like MapReduce, we can compare our SQL version with them to draw a clusion about SQL's unique charastic in solving data analytic tasks.

  \item[PageRank:] Determine the importance of every node of a graph based on its connectivity. 
  \item[Connected Components:] Partition the nodes of a graph also based on its connectivity.
