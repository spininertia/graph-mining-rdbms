\subsection{Project Development}
All the project related activity(code, report) are managed by Github\footnote{https://www.github.com}, a collaborative development community. All tasks are mapped into \emph{issues}, each phase is a \emph{milestone}. We fork from a central repository, when we finish our assigned tasks(issue), we send a pull request to the central repository. We are responsible for code review each other's code, then merge into the central repository. It's easy to see each team member's contribution by review the history of pull request and commit. The project address is here.\footnote{https://github.com/essex405/graph-mining-rdbms}
