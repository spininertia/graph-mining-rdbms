The first paper was the wavelet paper by Daubechies
\cite{Daubechies92Ten}
\begin{itemize*}
\item {\em Main idea}: instead of using Fourier transform,
      wavelet basis functions are localized in frequency {\em and} time.
      It turns out that they fit real signals better,
      in the sense they need fewer non-zero coefficients to reconstruct
      them. Thus they achieve better compression.
\item {\em Use for our project}:
      it is extremely related to our sound-clip similarity
      project, because we can use the top few wavelet coefficients
      to compare two sound clips.
\item {\em Shortcomings}:
      The Daubechies wavelets require a wrap-around setting,
      which may lead to non-intuitive results.
\end{itemize*}
